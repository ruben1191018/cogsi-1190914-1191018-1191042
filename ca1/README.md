# CA1 Report

## Part 1 ( No branches )

### Step 1: Setting Up the Project
We began by copying the "Building REST Services with Spring" application into a new 
directory (ca1). After that, we created the first issue to track progress.

### Step 2: Initial Commit
With the issue in place, we proceeded with the initial commit. The steps were as follows:

- git pull – to ensure the latest version of the repository is up-to-date.
- git add ca1/ – to stage the newly added files. 
- git commit – to commit the changes. 
- Add the commit message: #1 Add the correct repo. 
- git push – to push the commit to the repository.

### Step 3: Adding .gitignore
After this, we created Issue 2, which involved adding a .gitignore file to the project:

- git pull – to fetch the latest changes.
- git add .gitignore – to stage the .gitignore file.
- git commit – with the message Add gitignore #2.
- git push – to push the commit.

### Step 4: Release Creation

After completing the initial setup and configuration, we created Release 1.1.0 for the project.

### Step 5: Project Enhancements
Subsequently, a change was made to the project links by adding two new fields to the Employee model. The necessary support for these new fields was also implemented.
